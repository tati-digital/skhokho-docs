## Add New Members to Company
Based on the pricing above, and the number of employees you have selected. You can then add these employees directly from your settings page. Go to the third panel and you will see all the current members, pending invites and a button to add new members. You will also see the current allowance of members, based on your selection.

![Add New Member to Skhokho](/img/add_members.png)

When you click on the "Invite New Member Button" You will be able to add the names, email and job title of the member you are inviting.

::: tip
Very important to note at this stage is to select the right line manager for the member you are inviting. The line manager should already have been invited and have "Manager App" access
:::

The Invite Member form looks like so:
![Invite Member Form Skhokho](/img/invite_form.png)

At the bottom of the form you can see all the access rights that are possible. These will depend on the package you have selected. Your organisation can have Sales App access, but you grant that permission to only a few people who work with sales. Same applies for Project App and Accounting.
Accounting and Project App can only be accesses from Tier 3 - Business Package, while Sales App access can only be accessed from Tier 3 - Business Pro Package.
All accounts have Manager and HR App access, as these are included in the Starter Package or Tier 1. However, when you send the invite, only Grant HR App Access to your HR Manager, or the person in your organisation who will deal with HR. As HR access allows the person who has it to view HR files of employees, Payslips and Leave records.

::: warning
Anyone grated HR App access can view employee records, payslips and leave records. They can also adjust the HR settings of your organisation, including pay-date and execute payroll runs.
:::

Also take special precaution when selecting Manager App access, users with Manager App, have the same ability as the company owner to invite members to the platform. However all members they invite will be reporting to them. See more in the manager App Documentation.

::: danger
Manager App access can grant the owner permission to invite new members to the company space.

## Organisational Structure
Skhokho Business Management Software was designed to operate like a business, allow managers and owners to run their businesses more efficiently. Therefore, the business org structure is built in to the app design.
The Business Owner, assumed to be the individual who created the space - will have full access. This cannot be changed at a later stage. That business owner can then invite members to join, and grant then access accordingly.

Ideally, depending on the role a members has - access rights should be granted accordingly.
![Company Organisational Structure](/img/org_structure.png)
Every member that is invited, requires a line manager to be assigned to them. Initially, the owner can select themselves as line managers - when inviting the top-level managers. These managers will then be able to invite their own team members, or the owner can do it. When they invite a team member - they must select themselves as line managers for these team members.
Line Managers must have Manager Rights, in order to allow them to effectively manager their teams, assign tasks and approve leave.
