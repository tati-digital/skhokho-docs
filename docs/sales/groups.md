# Mailing Lists

You can send newsletter emails directly from your Skhokho Dashboard, for sales and marketing. Email newsletters are known to be one of the most efficient way to send targeted campaigns at a group of people. With Skhokho we give you the ability to send out group emails, to grow your small business.

## Skhokho Philosophy
At Skhokho we believe in simple is best, the group emails sent out will be HTML format, but look like emails that come directly from your inbox. You will be able to enter your own SMTP settings, so that you can send emails directly from your email provider and communicate with your clients on a personal level.

Our group email system is designed to look natural and personal.

## Get Started
To get started with sending group emails, you need SMTP settings for your email provider. You can get an email account, with your own domain [from domains.co.za here](https://www.domains.co.za/aff.php?aff=2851).

You will need the following:

| Requirements   | Example              |
|---------------:|---------------------:|
| SMTP Host      | mail.domain.co.za    |
| SMTP PORT      | 587                  |
| SMTP username  | name@email.com       |
| SMTP password  | ***********          |

These are the same email settings you would use to set-up your mail client. Speak to your IT department for assistance if you are struggling to obtain the above information.

::: tip
You will need access to the Sales App to use the mailing functionality

### Save your Sales SMTP Settings
Go to the SMTP Settings page in your [Sales CRM App here](https://skhokho.io/sales/sales-smtp-settings/edit). When here you can then enter your SMTP settings, it is advised that you select Mail Use TLS and Port 587 for safer email communication.

## Email Marketing Contact Groups
Before you can get started with sending marketing or group emails, you will need to create the contact groups. Contact groups are groups of similar contacts that you would like to send the same emails. Within a sales department, you could have market segments or departments that require you to send different emails to different people.

To get started navigate to the [Email Contact Group Page](https://skhokho.io/sales/contact-group/view) here.

![Add New Mailing List for marketing campaign](/img/add_new_mailing_list_marketing_campaign.png)

Click the "create" button at the top of the page to create a new contact group.

![CRM Email Marketing Mailing List](/img/crm_email_marketing_mailing_list.png)

Add a suitable Name for the contact group, so you will be able to identify it from a list. Then add a suitable description for your records, so all the other team members who come across this list will know the purpose of the list. When you are done, submit the form and a new list will be created.

### Contact Group Actions
From this table, the following actions are available:
1. Ability to add members to the contact group
2. View/Interact with email templates for this contact group
3. Delete a contact group

### Contact Group Table Metrics
From the contact group table you can view the following metrics:
1. Number of contacts in the contact group
2. The subscription percentage of that group

:::tip
Every time someone unsubscribes from your emails the subscription percentage will be updated. By law the "unsubscribe" button is included in all mails sent out from Skhokho. The user email address will remain in your list, but emails will no longer be sent to them from the system.
