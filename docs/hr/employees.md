You can see their names, title and appointment date.

::: tip
The first time the employee sets their employee records, the appointment date will not be set, as they cannot set their own appointment date. As the HR manager - you will need to set the date on their behalf. Click on the button "Add Date" to add the appointment date.

## HR Report
The HR manager can pull out a HR report which will show a snapshot of the current state of HR in PDF format, to be used in meetings, other reporting etc.
