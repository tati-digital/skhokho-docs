# HR Policies

HR managers of the organisation will add HR policies to the system as required. You can view all [company HR policies](https://skhokho.io/hr/personal/hr-policy-view) on this page.

## Accept HR Policy
You can view and download any policy for your records, or read the policy directly from the application. When you have completed reading the policy, you can accept the policy by clicking on the "accept policy" button next to the relevant policy.
