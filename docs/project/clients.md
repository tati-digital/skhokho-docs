## Client List

::: tip
You need project app rights to access the sections described in this documentation.
:::

The Project App is one of the places where you can see the client list for the organisation, [access the client list here](https://skhokho.io/projects/clients/view). This enables project personnel to be able to add clients to the platform and associate clients with certain projects. The client list which is visible on this page, is also the same client list visible to the Sales Team and Accounting Team.
