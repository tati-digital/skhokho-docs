When you send the invite, the member will receive an email with a link to join your company space as your team member.

::: tip
When you are inviting new team members, always use the invite from inside the app. Do not send them login, registration link for them to create separate accounts. For team members to collaborate on the same company, they must receive an invite from inside the organisation. If someone created a separate account, they cannot be added to your team later on.
