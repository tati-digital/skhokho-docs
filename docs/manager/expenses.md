## Approve Expenses

All the employees reporting to you can create expense requests in their own personal app, and as a manager you have the option to approve or reject expenses. The only other person that can approve or reject expenses is the accounting manager, with access to the accounting app.

:::tip
When you approve an expense, it will be included automatically in the business accounting records as a business expense. When the accounting manager view or prints the management accounts, that expense will be in the total sum. Therefore it is important that you communicate with the accounting department and agree on expense approval workflow.
