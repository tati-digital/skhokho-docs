# Client Portal

Clients can access the platform through a client portal. A client must be invited by a member of the project
team from inside Skhokho app. They will receive an email with an invite link, that link will lead them to a
registration page, where they can set a password to create a client account.

:::tip
Note a client account is different from a general access Skhokho account, clients can only view the project they
were invited to view. Clients can however upgrade their accounts and create their own
Skhokho profile with their own projects. When they do that, they will be able to continue as normal with their
skhokho account, while being able to view the projects they are clients on.
:::

When a client accepts an invite, they will be led to this page:

To accept the invite, enter your password and a new profile will be created.

You will be led to the client dashboard, where all the projects you have access to as a client will be listed.

:::tip
Note, one client can be granted access to multiple projects, even with the same email address, you only need to
create a profile once. If you are added again as a client contact - the project you were added on will just
appear on your list of projects here.
