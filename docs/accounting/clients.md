# Clients

The [Client view page](https://skhokho.io/accounting/accounting-clients/view) can be found here. Here you can see a list of all your clients.

:::tip
Because Skhokho is an integrated software, the clients you see here, are the same clients that are on the Project app, visible to the project team. As they create projects, assign them to clients - they can pick clients from this list or add to it. As the accounting team creates invoices, and quotes - they can assign them to clients who are already on the system with active projects.
