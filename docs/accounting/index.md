It is important that you start by setting this information at the beginning of your set-up and test the SMTP settings.

Enter all your business information as you need it to appear in your official accounting docs. Enter the SMTP settings for the email address you would like to use to email clients with invoices and quotes.
This is so that clients see your company domain from your invoices and associate your invoices with your business.

## Accounting Dashboard

The accounting dashboard gives you a quick snapshot of the current state of affairs within the business.
